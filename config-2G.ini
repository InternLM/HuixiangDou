# introduction = "For evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a fully open-source, reproducible evaluation framework, supporting one-stop evaluation for large language models and multimodal models. Based on distributed technology, it can efficiently evaluate models with a large number of parameters. The evaluation directions are summarized in five capability dimensions: knowledge, language, understanding, reasoning, and examination. It integrates and collects more than 70 evaluation datasets, providing in total over 400,000 model evaluation questions. Additionally, it offers evaluations for three types of capabilities specific to large models: long text, security, and coding."
